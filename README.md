# Introductions to Python and Applied Health Data Science Training

With the need to analyse large genetic or biomedical datasets and a growing interest in applying machine learning to biomedical research, we present this 3-day training as an introduction to Python and Data Science. The purpose of the course is to get you up to speed for your research involving data science, with the necessary basics of using Python and its basic data science libraries, whilst also complementing other training resources available in the university.

This course is suitable for PGR students in the Medical School with limited/no experience in programming and is tailored to the use case of biomedical research. The objective is that after this course, the students can have a basic idea of the key elements for conducting a biomedical data science project, including
-	Basic Python programming skills
-	Querying data through web service
-	Processing the data
-	What can machine learning do in biomedical research and basic practice

We will include examples from biomedical research and hands-on exercises using existing biomedical datasets (e.g., breast cancer Wisconsin dataset, and the WHO COVID-19 dataset). 

Materials and datasets for the training will be added one day before the course.

## Pre-Course Material

## Day 1: Python Basic (4 Nov)
For a day in Python 101, we will cover basic elements of the Python programming language, including variables, data structures, control structures, functions, etc. We will also introduce tools for running code in Python, such as the Jupyter Notebook environment and the Visual Studio Code text editor.

## Day 2: Working with Data Source (5 Nov)
We will go through the process of working with a data source, starting by getting the data from an external source (e.g., the WHO COVID-19 dataset). Then, we will introduce some libraries (e.g. Numpy, Pandas, Seaborn) for handling and visualising the data.

## Day 3: Machine Learning and Large Language Model Fundamentals (11 Nov)
We will introduce machine learning and large language models and give some examples of their application in biomedical research. As machine learning is a broad topic, we would like to give some basic ideas about it in this one-day tutorial so the students can explore it further in their future research.
