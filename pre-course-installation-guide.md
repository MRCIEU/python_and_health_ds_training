# Pre-course installation guide

This guide will help you set up the working environment (a conda virtual environment) for this project.

The main steps are:
1. Save the environment file
2. Install a conda distribution
3. Create the conda environment

If you have trouble with any of the steps, there are a few resources at [Reference](#reference) which might be of help.
You could also come to the drop-in session.

# Save the environment file

If you do not know how to use git and git repositories, you should save the link below to your computer in a directory / folder where you want to use as the working directory (e.g. `~/Downloads`) and save it as "environment.yml".

https://github.com/MRCIEU/python_and_health_ds_training/raw/refs/heads/main/environment.yml

If you have already known how to work with git repositories, you could also clone this repository locally and use the local environment.yml file there.

# Install a conda distribution

You should then install a "conda distribution" (i.e. anaconda or miniconda), via the command line or using a graphical tool. If you already have conda installed in your system, you can skip to the next step.

## Graphical tool (Anaconda Navigator)

If you prefer a graphical tool, you can download and install anaconda from here https://www.anaconda.com/download and follow the official instruction steps (note: you can skip the registration). We recommend people using Windows to use this approach.

If the installation is successful, you should be able to find and launch the Anaconda Navigator (see below) from your operating system.
