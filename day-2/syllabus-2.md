# Day 2 (5 Nov): Working with Data Source (Weili Qiu)

Morning 9:30 - 12:00

Afternoon 13:00 - 17:00

# Objective
- Learn how to read and write files using Python 
- Learn how to view, filter, impute, concatenate, truncate data using numpy and pandas 
- Understand what web requests and responses are, and how to interact with web APIs 

# Material

Jupyter Notebook, Weekly COVID-19 cases, COVID-19 vaccination data

# Timetable

**9:30 – 9:45 Data Analysis Intro & Prep**

- Looking at the data: Weekly COVID-19 cases, COVID-19 vaccination data
- At the end of the day we will reproduce some of the visualisation shown on the WHO website 
- What will be done with the data? (Outline of the day) 

**9:45 – 10:15 File Handling**
- Read and write file(s): Random files, Weekly COVID-19 cases, COVID-19 vaccination data 
- Pickling and JSON serialisation 
- Hands-on

**10:15 – 10:45 Data Manipulation (Numpy and Pandas)**
- What is array and how it differs from list? (faster, matrix, statistics usage) 
- Create, visit, modify, and copy array 
- Axes, Reshape and concatenation 
- Basic math 
- Statistics (minimum, maximum, etc.) 
- Hands-on

**10:45 – 11:00 Break**

**11:00 – 11:45 Data Manipulation (Numpy and Pandas)**

Series and DataFrame 

- Visit Elements 
- Filter data and make conditional changes
- Handle Missing values 
- Hands-on

**12: 00 – 13: 00 Lunch Break**

**13:00 – 13:45 Data Manipulation (Numpy and Pandas)**
- Concatenation 
- Statistics 
- Saving the data 
- Visualisation 
    - Scope (“canvas”) of matplotlib 
    - Elements:  
    - Figures: bar, line, histogram, pie, box & Whisker 
    - Resize and save fig
- Hands-on

**13:45 – 14:00 Break**

**14:00 - 15:30 Web**
- Use OpenGWAS (semantic), EBI (RESTful), and PubMed (homework / only if there is time left, due to its unreliability) 
- Request and Response (What happens during this process) 
    - HTTP verb 
    - Status code and contents of responses 
- Understanding API docs 
- Timeout and error handling 

**15:30 - 16:00 Miscellaneous (optional, depending on time)**

Performance and Best Practice

- Python list, dict and set, and searching for an element 
- Every little helps but avoid negative optimisation 
- Lambda and df.apply(), df.assign()
