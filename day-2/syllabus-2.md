**14:00 – 14:15 Break**

**14:15 - 15:30 Interact with Web API**

Use: OpenGWAS (semantic), EBI (RESTful), and PubMed (homework / only if there is time left, due to its unreliability) 

- Request and Response (What happens during this process) 
    - HTTP verb 
    - Status code and contents of responses 
- Understanding API docs 
- Timeout and error handling 
- Hands-on

**15:30 - 16:00 Miscellaneous (optional, depending on time)**

NOTE: This part was not delivered because we spent more time in the morning reviewing what we learned in Day 1.

Performance and Best Practice

- Searching for an element in Python list, dict and set
- Every little helps but avoid negative optimisation 
- Lambda and df.apply(), df.assign()
