# Objectives
- Learn how to read and write files using Python 
- Learn how to view, filter, impute, modify, concatenate, reshape data using Numpy and Pandas 
- Understand what web requests and responses are, and how to interact with web APIs 

# Material

Jupyter Notebook, Weekly COVID-19 cases, COVID-19 vaccination data

# Timetable

**9:30 – 9:45 Intro & Prep**

- Read and write file(s)
- Pickling and JSON serialisation 
- Hands-on

**10:15 – 10:45 Data Manipulation (Numpy)**
- Numpy array
- Create, visit, modify and copy array (and matrix)
- Axes, reshape and concatenation 
- Arithmetic
- Statistics
- Hands-on

**10:45 – 11:00 Break**

**11:00 – 11:45 Data Manipulation (Pandas)**

- Series and DataFrame

    - Scope (“canvas”) of matplotlib 
    - Elements of a figure
    - Types of figures: bar, line, histogram, pie, box & Whisker 
    - Resize and save fig
- Hands-on

**13:45 – 14:00 Break**

**14:00 - 15:30 Interact with Web API**

Use: OpenGWAS (semantic), EBI (RESTful), and PubMed (homework / only if there is time left, due to its unreliability) 

- Request and Response (What happens during this process) 
    - HTTP verb 
    - Status code and contents of responses 
- Understanding API docs 
- Timeout and error handling 
- Hands-on

**15:30 - 16:00 Miscellaneous (optional, depending on time)**

Performance and Best Practice

- Searching for an element in Python list, dict and set
- Every little helps but avoid negative optimisation 
- Lambda and df.apply(), df.assign()
